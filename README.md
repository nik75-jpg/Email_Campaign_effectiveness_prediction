This project's objective is to develop a machine learning model that can classify and track emails sent using Gmail-based email marketing campaigns. Small- to medium-sized business owners who want to boost the efficiency of their email marketing campaigns and boost client retention will employ this technique.

Identifying which emails are read, deleted, or acknowledged by the reader is one of the key issues in email marketing. Business owners may modify their marketing strategies and improve their chances of success by learning which emails engage readers the most.

We will collect information on a range of email attributes, such as the subject line, sender name, email content, email format, and frequency, in order to solve this issue. We will also take into account the emails' intended readership as well as any additional pertinent information.

With the use of this information, we will train a machine learning model to determine if a recipient is more likely to read, ignore, or acknowledge a message. This model will be able to assess fresh emails and forecast how the reader will probably react to them.

We will divide our data into a training set and a testing set so that we can compare the model's performance between the two. The training set will be used to fit the model, and the testing set will be used to gauge how well it performs. We will evaluate the model's accuracy and efficiency using a number of metrics, including precision, recall, and F1 score.

The model can be used to help small- to medium-sized business owners increase the efficiency of their email marketing campaigns after it has been trained and tested. They will be able to target their marketing efforts more effectively and boost customer retention by utilising the model to characterise and track emails.

The overall goal of this project is to give owners of small to medium-sized businesses a strong tool for enhancing the efficiency of their email marketing efforts. They will be better equipped to make judgements and raise the likelihood that their marketing initiatives will be successful by utilising machine learning to characterise and track emails.
